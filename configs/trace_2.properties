# This file specifies a trace of CPU and I/O activity.
# Traces are named, and the trace named ROOT must exist, and it
#   is resolved first.  The ROOT trace can include other named
#   traces, and it can contain sequences of CPU and I/O activity.
#  Trace names can have two suffixes, .TR and .REPS
# The .TR entry holds the trace definition.
# The .REPS entry holds the number of times that trace is repeated.
#    ROOT.TR must resolve to a trace that begins with a CPU burst.
